### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python3] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [PyGame] - awesome web-based text editor


### How to run

To run the game you need to install python3 and pygames first. After that is done all you have to do is run main.py .

### Todos

 - It still lacks a visual button to show what grid are you selecting
 - No way to prevent eternal looping still.
